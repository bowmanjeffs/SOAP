#SOAP - Superoxide Analysis Products

This is a collection of R scripts to model superoxide concentration and production from chemoluminescence data (i.e. obtained from the methylcuprin luciferase analog method).  The scripts should be reasonably self explanatory for anyone familiar with the method, however, not all parameters are easily recognized in the current versions.  If you have any questions please post as an issue.
